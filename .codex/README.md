 # .codex — Assistant & Dev Guide

 This folder holds lightweight docs the AI assistant (and humans) follow while working in this repo. It keeps decisions, conventions, and day‑to‑day run commands close to the code.

 Contents:
 - AGENT_GUIDE.md — How the assistant operates in this repo
 - GUIDELINES.md — Coding conventions and change management
 - RUNBOOK.md — How to run client/server locally
 - TODO.md — Lightweight backlog the assistant can execute
 - DECISIONS.md — Log of noteworthy decisions (mini ADRs)

 Usage tips:
 - Keep items concise and actionable; prefer checklists over prose.
 - Update TODO.md as a source of truth for near‑term work.
 - Record non‑obvious choices in DECISIONS.md to avoid re‑litigating later.
