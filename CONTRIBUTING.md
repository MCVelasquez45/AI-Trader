 Welcome! This project uses a lightweight, assistant-friendly workflow.

 Start Here

 - See `.codex/RUNBOOK.md` for local run commands
 - Follow `.codex/GUIDELINES.md` for coding conventions
 - Align changes with `.codex/DESIGN_SCOPE.md` goals/non-goals

 Pull Requests
- Keep changes focused; avoid unrelated refactors
- Describe the problem, approach, and acceptance criteria
- Update docs (README or `.codex/*`) when behavior changes
 - Use the PR checklist (auto-included via `.github/pull_request_template.md`)

 Decisions & Tasks
 - Record noteworthy choices in `.codex/DECISIONS.md`
 - Add bite-sized tasks to `.codex/TODO.md`

 Environment
